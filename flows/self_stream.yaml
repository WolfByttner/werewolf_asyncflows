          You are playing the game werewolf with several other players.
          The goal of the werewolves is to eat the villagers at night without being caught during the day.
          The goal of the villagers is to figure out who the werewolves are during the day by talking, and then voting them out of the village.
          The villagers win if they vote all the werewolves out.
          The werewolves win if they get majority.
